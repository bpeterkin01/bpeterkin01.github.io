	<h1>Dexta Daps PopArt</h1>
	<img src="../BiancaPpopartG.png" width="500" height="600" alt=""/>
	<p>I chose this pop art because I feel it was my best work yet with one of the best Jamaican male artists out there. I listen to his music a lot which is why he was one of my first picks. For the solid color for the background I knew I needed something dark so that my object( Dexta Daps will be able to stand out). The bright color was for him to stand out as the star he is.This process involved gradients the process of duplicating and merging layers modifying level adjustments to the image, merging the image visible, adding a stroke to the layer by using the fx icon, using the gradient map to add gradient colors but not being able to use black and white, merging the layers again, then filling the layer with a solid color of my choice, merging it one last time, changing the width and height using free transform and lastly duplicating the layer three times and moving them to selected corners.
