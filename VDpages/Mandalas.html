        My love for flowers is like a manâ€™s love for his dogs. This is why my original shape is a flower. I wanted some nice bright colorful flowers so I chose light blue and pink. This process took evenly distributing the flower on the page, having to rotate the flowers as well. Scaling it to make the flower bigger or smaller was also a step. Lastly, copying and pasting the flowers and scaling it constantly till you get it how you like in a circular shape.
