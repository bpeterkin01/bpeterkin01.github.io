  <p>   What started off as a thanksgiving table with food turned into something unrecognizable. Light blue is one of my favorite colors which is why the primary color is blue. After changing the filters and making the original picture unrecognizable the next steps were mainly copy and pasting and transforming. First copying the original image three more times. And transforming them by flipping them horizontally and vertically till they collide and look the opposite from the one above or below it.
