    <p> Hey my name is Bianca and I was born in New york but I classify as a Jamaican. The reason why is because I was raised by Jamaican parents so I have more of a Jamaican background.Also I eat more Jamaican food than American food.</p>

     <h2><em>Growing Up</em></h2>

    <p> Ever since I was little I found my taste for music. No not singing well I did try I was in choir but in reality that was not my cup of tea. Freestyling was actually for me I realized I was very good at it that really amazed. </p>

     <h3><em>Present Time</em></h2>
     
    <p> At this moment in my life I still use freestyling and writing poems as a way to express myself but I am also doing bigger and bettter things. I got into a nice Law Institue program, I am helping spread the importance of voting and I am also in the most importance year of highschool.
