<h1>Christmas Prayer </h1>
<img alt = "Prayer" src = "Prayer.jpg" " height = "150" width = "250">
<p > In my culture you must always say prayer before you eat. This doesn't stop during Christmas. Someone chooses to pray, we hold hand and bow our heads. In my opinion I like whwn the prayer is sweet and short because I don't want the sweet good cooking to get cold. </p>
