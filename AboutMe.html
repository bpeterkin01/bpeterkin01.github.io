	  <h2> Politic Me</h2>
	<p> My name is Bianca I have past history of being involved with Politics within my city I was able to make score cards and learn gain knowledge during this whole process. I also was a big help during the primary election of 2020  I began Yvote with a regular status as just a member but was then promoted to Peer leader due to outstanding work I have done. I did text banking which was texting to help promote and also help people with their voting needs from helping them register to vote to informing them about the canditates! The orginzation was known as nonpartisan as well.</p>
	
	<h2> Sports </h2>
	<p>Since I was little my dad has work in a retail sports store, so I got introduce to almost every sport. He used to buy me and my sister soccer ball, tennis rackets and tennis ball, basketballs even skates. We used to always go to the playground and practice each sport on our free time. Mainly I had a love for tennis and basketball since that was the sport I played the most and did very good in. As i continue to grow my sister got me into the rhythm with volleyball and that became a sport I was not so good in at first but because of how much love I had for the sport I never gave up on it especially when I played again in my middle school, that started my drive again. I began to practice and practice and got so much better </p>
	
	<h2> Favorite Foods</h2>
	<p>I was born in America but grew up in a Jamaican Household so I was introduced to Jamaican food from birth. Which is why I strongly have a liking for it. Some different foods I like consist of spicy and sweet such as Jerk chicken and Jerk Pork with Rice and Peas, Stew chicken, Potato Salad,Curry Chicken/goat, bbq chicken,Festival,and Dumpling.Being born in America I still got adopted to American food and different cultures foods asd well because that is what I was surronded by when I go outside and its a mix of cultures when you come to America. My favorites range from many different types I like chicken over rice(halal), I like birria tacos with cheese(mexican), I like baked mac and cheese with fried chicken,cheeseburgers as well(soul food), I like spaghetti/ pastas such as ziti, pizza as well(Italian), </p>
	
	<h2>Inspirtations</h2>
	<p>As I grew up I looked up to my mom and sisters. My mom </p>
	
	
	<h2> Goals</h2>
	<p> Right now I am so confused about which college I really want to go to. I don't know if I applied to this college only due to the fact my friends are going there. Or the other college because my mom told me I must go there. Or even only looking into new york colleges because my family does not want me to go far away.And I question what if my major changes do I really want to be "stuck" in John Jay? Then after I graduate college I don't want to move into a apartment I don't believe they are safe. I will like to get a house of course so I'll have to pay off any college debt and build my credit. Then I want to be finanically stabled so my family wouldn't have to worry about anything. I am the youngest so I want to be able to take care of them all when they grow old. Lastly I want to get a husky because my mom does not want pets in the house right now.</p>
